SelectionHapStats is a repository of Python scripts to identify genomic loci under natural selection and R scripts to visualize the genomic signatures at loci under selection. This work is described in the README document README_selectionHapStats.pdf and in greater detail in the arXived paper: Recent selective sweeps in North American Drosophila melanogaster show signatures of soft sweeps (http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0906).
